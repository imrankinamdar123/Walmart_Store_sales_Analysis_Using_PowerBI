Detailed Process for Walmart Store Sales Analysis Using Power BI
Data Collection and Preparation

Gathered sales data from Walmart stores, including key metrics like sales revenue, customer count, product categories, and regional performance.
Ensured the data included relevant attributes such as date, store location, product ID, sales quantity, and promotional details.
Cleaned the data using Power Query in Power BI to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. For example:
Replaced missing sales figures with calculated averages or interpolated values.
Standardized date formats for temporal analysis.
Data Modeling

Designed a star schema by creating relationships between fact tables (e.g., sales transactions) and dimension tables (e.g., stores, products, and dates).
Implemented calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced metrics like Year-over-Year (YoY) growth, profit margins, and average transaction size.
Dashboard Development

Built interactive dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Total sales, gross margin, and average daily sales.
Top-performing stores and products.
Used visual elements like clustered bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps to represent data effectively.
Incorporated slicers and filters for users to explore data by store, region, date range, or product category.
